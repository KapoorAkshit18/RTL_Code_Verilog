# RTL_Code_Verilog
Basic building block of the digital circuit is written in verilog like half adder. full adder, multiplexer,flipflops of various configurations, and other synchrounous circuits  
Various modules are simulated in the Xilinx vivado tool 
The results of each are furthermore attached throughout each code
